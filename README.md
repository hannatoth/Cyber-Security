# fraud-detection-in-transactons


Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities in financial transactions using a data-driven approach. The analysis is centered around identifying patterns and discrepancies in transaction data, particularly between flagged and non-flagged frauds.

Dataset

The dataset includes financial transactions with a particular emphasis on transfer-type transactions. Key features analyzed include original old balance, maximum and minimum balances in both flagged and non-flagged transactions.

Analysis Highlights

Balance Analysis: We explore minimum and maximum balances for both flagged and non-flagged fraud cases to detect unusual patterns.
Fraud Detection Strategy: By analyzing the characteristics of flagged transactions, we aim to understand the criteria that lead to a transaction being flagged as fraudulent.
Oversampling Technique: To address the imbalance in the dataset, we employ oversampling techniques to better train our models on detecting fraud.
Techniques Used

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis
Imbalance Handling through Oversampling

Objective

The goal of this project is to enhance the accuracy of fraud detection mechanisms in financial systems by using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.
