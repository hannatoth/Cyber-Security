# fraud-detection-in-transactons


ðŸŒ¸ Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities in financial transactions using a data-driven approach. The analysis is centered around identifying patterns and discrepancies in transaction data, particularly between flagged and non-flagged frauds.

ðŸŒ¸ Dataset

The dataset includes financial transactions with a particular emphasis on transfer-type transactions. Key features analyzed include original old balance, maximum and minimum balances in both flagged and non-flagged transactions.

ðŸŒ¸ Analysis Highlights

Balance Analysis: We explore minimum and maximum balances for both flagged and non-flagged fraud cases to detect unusual patterns.
Fraud Detection Strategy: By analyzing the characteristics of flagged transactions, we aim to understand the criteria that lead to a transaction being flagged as fraudulent.
Oversampling Technique: To address the imbalance in the dataset, we employ oversampling techniques to better train our models on detecting fraud.
